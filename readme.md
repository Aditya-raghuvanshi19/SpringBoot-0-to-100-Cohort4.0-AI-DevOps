4. Document your progress via README updates, Jira/Trello boards or any workflow you prefer.  
5. At the end of each major project, include:  
   - Architecture diagram  
   - API documentation (Swagger link or markdown)  
   - Deployment steps (Docker/K8s)  
   - Test coverage report  
   - CI/CD pipeline screenshot or config file

## 📌 Tips & Recommendations  
- Ensure you have **Java 17+** installed (or as recommended by instructor).  
- Use **Spring Boot 3.x** as likely covered.  
- Familiarity with SQL (MySQL or PostgreSQL) will help you move faster.  
- Setup basic Git/GitHub repo structure from day 1.  
- Engage actively in live sessions and ask doubts—this course emphasises applying concepts, not just watching videos.  
- For the AI project, get comfortable with REST API calls to LLMs, vector databases, embeddings.  
- For the DevOps modules, practice locally using Docker Compose and MiniKube or kind/clusters before cloud deployment.  
- Maintain a personal learning log (daily/weekly) to track progress.
